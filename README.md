# Mission Spudnik:22
Welcome to **Mission Spudnik:22**, a resouce management simulation game developed in **Godot** as part of my university dissertation on **agent-based AI** and **automation**.

In this simulation, you’ll oversee a colony of robots tasked with managing potato production, distribution, and survival — all powered by autonomous decision-making and emergent AI behaviors.

## Project Overview

This project explores:
- Agent-based AI systems and decision-making
- Resource management and automation
- Emergent gameplay through simple rules and interactions
- Real-time simulation using Godot's scripting and physics engines

## Built With

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) (v4.2.1)  
- GDScript  
- Custom behavior trees and state machines

## Dissertation

This game forms the practical component of my final-year dissertation on **"Interactive Resource Management Simulation with AI Elements"**. A PDF version of the dissertation is available in the "Project Report" file.
